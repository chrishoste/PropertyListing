# Proplistings
During my last vacation between my third and fourth semster, i wanted to learn some Angular2, so this was the first tutorial I started to do. 
It´s a little app where you can store some Properties with GoogleLogin and Firebase in the backend.
This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.21.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
